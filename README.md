A Predictive model to avoid college dropouts 

        Problem statement 

The goal here includes a comprehensive validation and enhancement of a model, using new sources of student-level data and applying
additional machine learning approaches to improve predictive power. In this particular setting, we attempted to predict students who 
are unlikely to graduate on time as well as those who are more urgently in need of attention. Here, a student may not graduate on time when:
	the student dropped out of school sometime after enrollment, or the student was retained (i.e. needed to repeat a grade), and spent more 
  than four years in high school Further, even when students perform at their full potential, lack of information and guidance can often
  cause some to end up undermatching, that is, applying to colleges, or study fields below their capability or not applying at all. By 
  merging high school and college student datasets, detailed exploratory analysis illustrating which subgroups of students is prone 
  to a particular issue can be delivered.
         
         Solution
Given that identifying students who are at risk for not graduating on time is the purpose, data from previous high school or college cohorts 
will be required for the outcome to be modeled. We can then apply this predictive model on current students to predict their risk of falling behind.
Furthermore, we can as well apply survival analysis techniques to generate an urgency score associated with each of the students. This additional information
can be used by college counselors to decide which students are in most immediate need of attention.

Advance research: A combination of clustering techniques to compare students with similar academic and behavioral data but different demographics
can be used as well, to identify student groups that were undermatching relative to their peers.
